## Week 8 quiz

### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
* I wanted to choose the dream folding scene from the movie Inception showing the cityscape visually bending and folding as a source of inspiration for my project.

I hope to learn from the composition of superposition and repetition: the scene in the dream has a large number of parallel repetitive structures, but they are twisted and superimposed on each other, forming a psychedelic visual impact. I think we can try to use different levels of rotation, scaling and other movements in p5.js to make similar graphic elements produce this kind of repeated but irregular superposition effect.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
* Recursive
* Recursive repetition is a very powerful coding technique that can help achieve the dream folding effect. By applying tiny distortions to each repeating unit, we can create layered, distorted dreamscapes. By calling the drawing function recursively, slightly changing the position, size, or angle of the figure each time. This technique can be used in conjunction with p5.js or other drawing libraries to dynamically generate graphics with graphics on the screen.
